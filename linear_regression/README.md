# Linear Regression
### Summary
Linear regression is an analysis to try to predict future values given data.
It estimates the coefficient of a linear equation that approximates the data.

### Uses
- Estimate linear functions.
- Find patterns.
- Find trends.

### Considerations
- Data should be continous.
- Values should be independent.
- No considerable outliers.

## This Project
### Summary
Use linear regression with Surface Earth's Temperature as an argument for Global Warming.

With a line equation  we can see the trend for Earth's temperature, if the line is rising, that's an indication that earth is getting hotter.

### Dataset
The dataset is available at:
- https://datahub.io/core/global-temp

It contains years of data from earth's temperature.

### How to Run
- Download dataset and add it to `in` folder
- `python3 main.py`

### Results
The hypothesis was proven and we have an argument for Global Warming
